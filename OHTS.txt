CRASH COURSE ON HIGH SEAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a captain of your ship, it is your job to keep your crew alive and happy.

BUOYS
To be the best pirates there ever was, you have to sail further than anyone ever has.  Distance on the high seas is measured with buoys.
Hit sail to progress past buoys.
Keep your navigators alive to ensure you're sailing at optimal speed.
Amassing kittens will speed up the sailing process (your crew mates feel better around them).

FOOD
Every time you sail, your crew members get a little hungry and might take some food from your stores.
If you run out of food for too long, crew members will start dying.
You can buy food from merchant stores your come across while sailing.
Fishing will nab you some food as well.


MORALE
If morale hits 0, your crew will mutiny.
Play some music to boost morale

Using skills will deduct actions (exception for sailing, viewing details, and activating seals)
The death or wounding of a crew member will increase the cost of skills.
Sail to refresh skills.
Activating seals of Kanhere will increase the number of skills you can use each turn.
